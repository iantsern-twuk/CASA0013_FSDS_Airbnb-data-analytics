#### 1. InsideAirbnb Data Collection:
•Initially collected by Tom Slee (before 2015), now collected by Murray Cox and collaborators.
•The data is collected to provide an alternative to Airbnb’s official data, helping cities and communities make informed decisions about Airbnb’s impact.

#### 2. Purpose of Data:
•The IA data aims to challenge Airbnb’s potentially misleading public data, offering insights into its impacts, especially on residential neighbourhoods.
#### 3. Collection Method:
•Web scraping: automated software extracts publicly available data from Airbnb listings (e.g., description, location, property type).
•The method introduces biases and potential inaccuracies, such as missing deleted listings and issues with occupancy rate estimation.

#### 4. Impact of Collection Method:
•The data’s limitations include bias due to web scraping, missing information (e.g., deleted listings), and lack of occupancy information (using review counts instead). These issues could affect the completeness and accuracy of the dataset.
#### 5. Ethical Concerns:
•Ethical issues related to privacy infringement, especially with user data and Airbnb’s proprietary information, as well as the potential for data misuse.

#### 6.Airbnb in London: Trends and Insights:
•There is a rising trend of entire-home listings (64% in 2024), which shows the increasing commercialization of Airbnb. Multiple-unit hosts are also growing, with 52.2% of listings in 2024 attributed to them.
•These trends suggest a shift from home-sharing to commercial profit-making, negatively impacting local communities.

#### 7. Regulating Short-Term Lets (STLs) in London:
•Temporal Regulation: The 90-day limit for renting entire homes has reduced the proportion of long-term rentals. However, there may be workarounds like multiple listings per host to circumvent the regulation.
•Spatial Regulation: A spatial analysis of listings suggests that zoning or banning Airbnb in certain areas might not be effective, as both single- and multi-unit hosts tend to cluster in similar areas. Multi-unit hosts should face stricter regulations to reduce over-commercialization.
