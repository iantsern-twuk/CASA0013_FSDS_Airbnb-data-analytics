As cities around the world grapple with rising rents and housing shortages, short-term rental platforms like Airbnb have come under increasing scrutiny. But how much do we know about their true impact? While Airbnb offers its own curated data, researchers and communities often rely on InsideAirbnb—an open community project that scrapes publicly available listings to reveal what’s happening behind the scenes.

Take London, for example. In 2024, over 64% of listings were entire homes, and more than half were run by hosts managing multiple properties—a clear signal that Airbnb is shifting from a home-sharing model to a commercial enterprise. This growing trend raises serious questions about housing availability and neighbourhood change.

Although city authorities have tried to respond—with rules like the 90-day cap on entire-home rentals—hosts often find ways around them. And because commercial listings tend to cluster in the same areas, simple zoning restrictions aren’t enough. To truly protect housing and communities, more targeted and enforceable policies—especially against multi-unit hosts—are urgently needed.
